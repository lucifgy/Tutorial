Saturation arithmetic:

Is a type of arithmetic where operations are limited to a fixed range, if the result is greater or less than the range, then it'll be clamped to the max or min value.
For example, if the valid range is between -100 and 100 then the result of the operation will don't exceed 100 or ge below -100. 

60 + 40 = 100
60 + 50 = 100(due to the range)
(70 + 40) - 100 = 0
99 * 99 = 100

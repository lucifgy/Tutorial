On terminal it's possible to find and remove files rather than deleting 1 by 1.

//find . -name "*.txt" -exec rm/cp -rf {} //copyLocation \;
also possible to copy all selected files.

sprintf to add multiple strings (and to specific positions in the string)

In terminal you can move and rename the file with mv
